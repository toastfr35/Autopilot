# High-Level Requirements for NAV 

 - **NAV-001:** The NAV component shall provide a procedure to reset its internal state to ensure proper initialization and recovery from errors.

 - **NAV-002:** The NAV component shall provide the capability to disable navigation, maintaining the current heading, horizontal speed, and altitude.

 - **NAV-003:** The NAV component shall remain in the disabled state if the no target waypoints are available.

 - **NAV-004:** When enabled, the NAV component shall calculate the heading to the next waypoint based on the current position and the target waypoint, updating the navigation target heading if the required change is significant.

 - **NAV-005:** The NAV component shall determine if the aircraft is close enough to the next waypoint (within a predefined threshold) and transition to the next waypoint when appropriate, or change its state to disabled if no more waypoint are available.

 - **NAV-006:** The NAV component shall operate in real-time, continuously updating its state and navigation calculations based on the latest GPS data and waypoints.

 - **NAV-007:** The NAV component shall integrate GPS data, including latitude, longitude, altitude, and horizontal speed, to compute navigation parameters accurately.

 - **NAV-008:** The NAV component shall interface with the navigation subsystem to receive necessary data inputs and provide navigation status updates, ensuring seamless integration into the aircraft's avionics suite.
