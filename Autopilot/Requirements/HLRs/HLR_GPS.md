# High-Level Requirements for GPS 

 - **GPS-001:** The GPS component shall provide a procedure to reset its internal state to ensure proper initialization and recovery from errors.

 - **GPS-002:** The GPS component shall calculate the horizontal speed of the aircraft in knots based on changes in GPS coordinates over time.

 - **GPS-003:** The GPS component shall calculate the vertical speed of the aircraft based on changes in altitude over time.

 - **GPS-004:** The GPS component shall operate in real-time, continuously updating its state and speed calculations based on the latest GPS data and time measurements.

 - **GPS-005:** The GPS component shall interface with the GPS subsystem to receive necessary data inputs and provide speed status updates, ensuring seamless integration into the aircraft's avionics suite.
