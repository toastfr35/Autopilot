# High-Level Requirements for AFDS System

- **AFDS-001:** The AFDS component shall provide mechanisms to reset internal states and parameters for all control packages to ensure proper initialization and recovery.

- **AFDS-002:** The AFDS component shall have emergency override capabilities to ensure critical controls are managed during emergency situations.

- **AFDS-003:** The AFDS component shall manage the aircraft's altitude by setting the appropriate vertical speed to reach and maintain the desired altitude.

- **AFDS-004:** The AFDS component shall limit the vertical speed within a defined range to ensure safety and stability.

- **AFDS-005:** The AFDS component shall control the aircraft's heading by adjusting roll, rudder, and elevator controls to achieve and maintain the desired heading.

- **AFDS-006:** The AFDS component shall manage the aircraft's horizontal speed by adjusting the throttle control to reach and maintain the desired speed.

- **AFDS-007:** The AFDS component shall calculate throttle adjustments based on the horizontal speed correction.

- **AFDS-008:** The AFDS component shall manage the aircraft's vertical speed by adjusting the pitch control to reach and maintain the desired vertical speed.

- **AFDS-009:** The AFDS component shall ensure pitch control adjustments are within predefined limits to maintain vertical speed.

- **AFDS-010:** The AFDS component shall control the aircraft's pitch by adjusting the elevator control to achieve and maintain the desired pitch angle.

- **AFDS-011:** The AFDS component shall ensure pitch control adjustments are within safety limits.

- **AFDS-012:** The AFDS component shall control the aircraft's roll by adjusting the aileron control to achieve and maintain the desired roll angle.

- **AFDS-013:** The AFDS component shall handle emergency overrides to ensure roll control remains within safe limits.

- **AFDS-014:** The AFDS component shall engage GCAS maneuvers when necessary to avoid ground collisions.

- **AFDS-015:** The AFDS component shall disengage emergency states and reset controls when the emergency is resolved.
