# Autopilot demo (AFDS + GCAS + NAV + CDU)

The Autopilot Flight Director System (AFDS), Ground Collision Avoidance System (GCAS), waypoint navigation system (NAV) and Control & Display Unit (CDU) are demonstration avionics software modules designed to showcase basic automated flight control functionalities for manned aircraft. 
This project serves as a toy example to illustrate concepts related to flight control systems.

## Disclaimer:

**This software is intended for educational purpose only.**

## Key Features:

- **Automated Control:** The AFDS offers basic automated control of the aircraft's altitude, heading, and velocity, providing a simplified representation of flight management capabilities.

- **Demonstration:** While the AFDS provides a functional demonstration of automated flight control, it is not intended for practical use in real-world aircraft. It serves as a learning tool and a starting point for further exploration and experimentation.

- **Components tests:** Tests of the AFDS, GCAS and NAV components.

- **Flight Dynamic Model:** For simulation there is a choice of using the supplied FDM or using Microsoft Flight Simulator as external FDM.

- **Ada implementation:** The AFDS and NAV modules are written in Ada, the NAV module is in C.
